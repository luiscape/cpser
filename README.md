CPSer
=====

CPS is HDX's main normalized database for humanitarian data. This R package aims to make it easier the process of testing if the data fits the CPS model. It connects to ScraperWiki instances, and makes a series of pre-packaged and custom-made validation tests.

This package also generates the necessary configuration files necesasary for CPS to ingest data successfully -- if those are not yet included in the originating package.
